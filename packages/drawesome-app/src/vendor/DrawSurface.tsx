/*
 * Vendored from benjitaylor/drawesome master (packages/draw/src/components/DrawSurface.tsx)
 * with ONE functional change, our candidate fix for upstream issue #5:
 * `pointercancel` now DISCARDS the in-progress stroke instead of committing it.
 * A cancelled pointer was never the surface's to keep (palm rejection kicking in,
 * a pinch gesture starting, the browser taking over) — committing it leaves junk ink.
 * Everything else is byte-identical apart from imports resolving to the package.

   * laid down, and a dark hairline over a black stroke is nothing. Underneath a
   * dark hairline it reads as a sliver of light either side of a dark line.

   * On a dark canvas that same pair reads as a double outline instead — white,

   * disappear into, so both edges of the halo stay visible. Any concentric
   * sandwich does this; it is only invisible when the outer ring matches what
   * is behind it. So on dark there is one pale ring and nothing else, which is
   * legible over dark paper and over dark ink alike.
